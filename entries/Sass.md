# Sass

Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) is a CSS preprocessor that adds power and elegance to the basic CSS language. It provides features such as:

- Variables
- Nesting
- Mixins
- Inheritance
- Functions
- Modules

These features allow developers to write more maintainable, scalable, and modular CSS code. Sass compiles to standard CSS, which can then be included in web pages.
